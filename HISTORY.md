I started learning HTML5, CSS3, Php when I was 8 years old (now i'm 14 years old) and after that I started with Java. Of course, before that I was very interested in gaming, especially Minecraft, I had a Minecraft server (called "PArmyHD", I know the name is bad. This is just from GommeHD and my old channel name, which I unfortunately also no longer know) so I started nh website to code. It was really fun, so after the website development I also started to learn Java via [Programmieren Starten - Start Programming, it's a german channel](https://youtube.com/programmierenstarten/)... The story is endless lmao. I can do a total of 10 programming, 3 of which I have **self taught**.
